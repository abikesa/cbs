    "<span style=\"font-size:23px; font-weight:bold; color:red;\">1. Stress Zone (Red) - Cortisol, Adrenaline</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this zone, the body is in a heightened state of alertness or stress. Cortisol and catecholamines like adrenaline are usually elevated. This state may be essential for 'fight or flight' responses but can be detrimental if prolonged. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Research/Application Possibilities:**\n",
    "- Investigating how prolonged exposure to this \"stress zone\" impacts the aging process.\n",
    "- Development of interventions or therapeutics that can help regulate cortisol and catecholamines.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:23px; font-weight:bold; color:#DAA000;\">2. Flow Zone (Yellow) - NMDA Agonist, Dopamine</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the zone where people often find themselves fully immersed and engaged in an activity. Glutamate or NMDA agonists, as well as dopamine, would likely play a role in facilitating this mental state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research/Application Possibilities:**\n",
    "- Understanding how flow states could be artificially induced or enhanced for better productivity or learning.\n",
    "- Investigate how flow states change across the lifespan and their impact on cognitive health.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:23px; font-weight:bold; color:green;\">3. Chill Zone (Green) - GABA Agonists, Adenosine Blockers</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the body and mind are in a relaxed state. GABA agonists and adenosine blockers could facilitate this state, contributing to relaxation and recuperation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research/Application Possibilities:**\n",
    "- Studies on the role of these substances in sleep quality, stress reduction, and overall well-being.\n",
    "- Development of medications or therapies that promote relaxation without adverse side effects.\n",
