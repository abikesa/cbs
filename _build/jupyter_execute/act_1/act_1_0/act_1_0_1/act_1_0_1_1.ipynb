    "### Cellular/Tissue Level:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alcohol\n",
    "1. **GABA Receptors**: Increases the inhibitory action of GABA neurotransmitters, like benzodiazepines and barbiturates.\n",
    "2. **NMDA Receptors**: Inhibits excitatory neurotransmission.\n",
    "3. **Cytotoxicity**: At high doses, can lead to cell death and tissue damage.\n",
    "4. **Tissue Sensitivity**: Damages `liver` cells and can affect brain tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benzodiazepines\n",
    "1. **GABA Receptors**: Enhance the effect of GABA, leading to inhibited neural activity.\n",
    "2. **Ion Channel Modulation**: Less effect compared to barbiturates.\n",
    "3. **Cytotoxicity**: Generally lower than barbiturates or alcohol.\n",
    "4. **Tissue Sensitivity**: Mainly impacts nervous tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Barbiturates\n",
    "1. **GABA Receptors**: Enhance the inhibitory action of GABA neurotransmitters.\n",
    "2. **Ion Channel Modulation**: Affect potassium and calcium channels more significantly than benzodiazepines.\n",
    "3. **Cytotoxicity**: May induce apoptosis or necrosis in liver and neuron cells.\n",
    "4. **Tissue Sensitivity**: Nervous tissue and `muscle` tissue are particularly sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organ/Systems Level:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alcohol\n",
    "1. **Nervous System**: Depresses CNS, causing disinhibition, motor impairment, and altered judgment.\n",
    "2. **Liver**: Metabolizes alcohol; chronic use can lead to liver disease.\n",
    "3. **Cardiovascular System**: Can lead to cardiomyopathy.\n",
    "4. **Respiratory System**: High doses can depress respiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benzodiazepines\n",
    "1. **Nervous System**: Depress CNS activity, leading to sedation and anxiolytic effects.\n",
    "2. **Liver**: Generally less hepatic stress than alcohol or barbiturates.\n",
    "3. **Cardiovascular System**: Limited depression of cardiac activity.\n",
    "4. **Respiratory System**: Less respiratory depression than barbiturates, but still present especially in overdose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Barbiturates\n",
    "1. **Nervous System**: Depress CNS, causing sedation, anxiolytic effects, and hypnosis.\n",
    "2. **Liver**: Metabolizes barbiturates, affecting liver function with chronic use.\n",
    "3. **Cardiovascular System**: Depress cardiac activity and can cause hypotension.\n",
    "4. **Respiratory System**: Can depress respiratory function significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Person/Environment Level:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alcohol\n",
    "1. **Psychological Impact**: Euphoria to depression.\n",
    "2. **Addiction and Dependency**: High risk, both physical and psychological.\n",
    "3. **Interpersonal Relationships**: Can impact negatively.\n",
    "4. **Public Health**: Widely abused, many public health campaigns aim to reduce misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benzodiazepines\n",
    "1. **Psychological Impact**: Mood stabilization but potential for rebound anxiety.\n",
    "2. **Addiction and Dependency**: Risk exists, especially with prolonged use.\n",
    "3. **Interpersonal Relationships**: Can impact if misused.\n",
    "4. **Public Health**: Concern over prescription misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Barbiturates\n",
    "1. **Psychological Impact**: Mood elevation but can lead to depression.\n",
    "2. **Addiction and Dependency**: High risk.\n",
    "3. **Interpersonal Relationships**: Detrimental if misused.\n",
    "4. **Public Health**: Less commonly used due to overdose risk.\n",
