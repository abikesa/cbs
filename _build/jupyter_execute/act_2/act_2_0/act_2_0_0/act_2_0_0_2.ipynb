    "Your observation about the high Inter-Class Correlation (ICC) in these cases is quite insightful. ICC is often used to measure how strongly units in the same group resemble each other. In the context of religious or tribal festivities linked to lunar cycles or circadian rhythms, you would expect a high ICC within each group because the practices are standardized and consistent within each community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cultural Homogeneity and ICC:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traditions and Rituals**: Religious and cultural groups often have deeply ingrained traditions that are passed down through generations. This leads to homogeneity in practices and, consequently, high ICCs when measuring behaviors or practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Community Reinforcement**: Being part of a religious or cultural community often involves frequent communal activities and rituals. These reinforce the established norms and behaviors, sustaining a high ICC.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Socio-Cultural Barriers**: Factors such as language, shared history, and mutual experiences often serve as 'fetters,' limiting the variance within the group and thereby increasing the ICC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cosmic Rhythms and ICC:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scheduled Observances**: The timing of many religious and cultural festivities is closely tied to lunar or solar calendars. This introduces an external, cosmic factor that synchronizes behavior across large groups of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Biological Synchronization**: While the evidence is not definitive, the notion that lunar cycles could affect human biology would introduce another layer of cosmic influence on social behavior, potentially elevating ICCs further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these high ICCs could be beneficial for community-based interventions, policy-making, and social science research. For example, recognizing that a religious community has specific days of fasting or celebration could be crucial for healthcare planning or social services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your point also touches on the idea of \"freedom in fetters\" — the concept that creative expression (in this case, variations of rituals or celebrations) can flourish within a set framework (religious doctrines or cosmic cycles). These frameworks provide a rich tapestry for individual and communal expression while maintaining a high level of consistency, as reflected in a high ICC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the correlation between cosmic events and religious festivities could indeed be a remarkable example of how 'external parameters' like lunar cycles can influence 'internal parameters' such as social behaviors, resulting in high ICCs within specific communities.\n",
    "\n",

    "The subject matter of your paper aligns closely with the discussions we've had on Inter-Class Correlations (ICCs) and clustered behaviors. In your case, seasonal variations in living kidney donations serve as the \"tokens\" or factors that could influence behavior within specific groups—namely, different income tertiles and types of donor-recipient relationships. Here are some points that could be explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant ICC Applications for Your Paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ICC in Income Tertiles**: By breaking down your data into income tertiles, you essentially have subgroups within your larger sample. An ICC could be used to determine how strongly donation patterns are consistent within each income group during the summer months.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Donor-Recipient Relationship**: Different relationships between donors and recipients (biologically related versus unrelated) also offer an opportunity to calculate ICCs. If the summer surge is particularly strong among biologically related donors, this could imply an underlying social or even biological factor that is consistent within this \"class.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regional ICCs**: If your data includes geographical information, you could examine whether the summer surge is consistent across different regions of the United States. Different ICCs among regions could indicate unique local factors affecting donation rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Yearly Fluctuations**: You could also examine how the ICC has evolved over the decades (from the 1980s to 2020). An increasing ICC could suggest that the factors leading to a summer surge are becoming more consistent over time, while a decreasing ICC might suggest increasing variability or the influence of new, unforeseen factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Seasonal ICCs**: You might find it useful to compute ICCs for donations in other seasons to see if the summer patterns are truly unique or if other seasonal trends also show high ICCs within particular subgroups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Clustered Behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Socioeconomic Factors**: The fact that you observe similar patterns across all income tertiles could indicate that there are structural factors affecting everyone equally—perhaps school holidays, for example, which could free up potential donors from childcare responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sociocultural Norms**: If certain groups show exceptionally high ICCs, this could be an indicator that sociocultural norms around donation are particularly strong within those groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Policy Implications**: Understanding these ICCs and what they reveal about the data could be useful in policy or advocacy work. If a high ICC is observed in a particular group, targeted interventions could be developed for that group to either leverage the surge or address the slump in donations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### International Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cultural Specificity**: As you rightly mentioned, your findings would not necessarily hold significance for Uganda or other countries with different social, economic, or healthcare contexts. This further underlines the importance of ICC in understanding the unique clustered behaviors within specific populations or \"classes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, ICC could add an additional layer of analytical depth to your already comprehensive paper, offering insights into the degree of homogeneity within these observed seasonal trends across different groups.\n",

    "<p class=\"drop-cap\">As the clock struck five, shrieks could be heard in the distance. Outside a red-brick mansion at the University of Texas in Austin, a crowd of young women looked expectantly up the road. They had been singing and waving paper fans, hoping to slow their make-up’s inevitable slide down their faces in the oppressive heat. “This is the kind of material that shows sweat,” said one woman, inspecting her pink shirt with disapproval.</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The shrieking grew louder. Kristin Wallach, a woman in her 50s standing on the edge of the group, started filming on her phone. “Here they come,” she said. As a pack of girls ran towards the house, the welcome party whooped with anticipation. When they got there, both groups of women fell on each other, screaming with delight. It was like a medieval battle scene – chainmail and crossbows replaced with sundresses, designer trainers and expensive handbag.</p>\n",

    "I was in Austin to witness Bid Day – when students find out whether their application to join a sorority has been successful. Fourteen percent of undergraduates at the University of Texas belong to a sorority or fraternity (at other universities the figure is much higher). Across America, these single-sex clubs, steeped in ritual and tradition, give their members opportunities to socialise and network. Sororities and fraternities are national organisations, with branches at various universities, and membership lasts a lifetime. Their secrets are keenly guarded, as is their privilege. In 2013 the University of Alabama ordered its sororities to stop segregation based on race, after an outcry when two of its black students were allegedly excluded from a sorority (in response the sorority said it “prohibits discrimination on the basis of race”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Amid the national soul-searching that followed the murder of George Floyd in 2020, a wave of students at various universities quit their sororities and fraternities, complaining about racism, misogyny and elitism. The National Panhellenic Conference, an association of sororities, proclaimed the importance of diversity, and announced its intent to make recruitment more inclusive. Many sororities have stopped giving preferential treatment to applicants just because their mothers were members.\n",

    "\n",
    "The pandemic was already changing how women applied to the groups. Traditionally, recruitment involved a paper application and a week-long process known as “rush” during which sororities and applicants suss each other out in round after round of parties. During covid, rush at most universities went virtual. Without the chance to impress in person, women had to make sure they looked even more amazing on paper – only the most sparkling resumés and letters of recommendation would do. Some sororities asked for video statements, even essays.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the easing of covid restrictions, the application process remains more demanding and complicated than it used to be. Enter the sorority consultants, a growing band of women whom parents can hire to coach their daughters on how to get into the sisterhood of their choice. Wallach, the woman filming rush, is one such consultant. At the University of Texas to enjoy the fruit of her labours, she Ubered between sorority houses, receiving clammy hugs and well-wishes from her ecstatic clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wallach (pictured below), had been informally shepherding friends’ daughters through sorority recruitment for years. But during the pandemic her phone “rang off the wall”, she said. “People were freaking out: ‘everything’s going virtual, we don’t know what to say, what to do’,” She teamed up with a friend to launch a company, which they called Sorority 101. For between $500 and $1,800, depending on how much shepherding girls require, they teach applicants what to wear and what to say. (This is relatively cheap. One consultant I spoke to charges up to $4,000.) This year, said Wallach, they coached over 120 women.    \n",
    " \n",
    "When I met her she was wearing a fuchsia top with a matching scarf, white shorts and espadrilles. Wallach comes from a “Greek” family, but that doesn’t mean her grandparents were from Athens. “Greek life” is a common way to describe sororities and fraternities, a reference to the letters of the Greek alphabet that stand for the organisations’ names. Wallach belongs to the same sorority as her mother and sister-in-law; her husband belongs to the same fraternity as her father.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "I asked Wallach what she liked about Greek life. She laughed and said, “Girl, do you have five hours?” The condensed version of her answer involves: hanging out with friends (“fun”), opportunities to cultivate leadership skills (“really fun”) and raising money for charity (“super fun”). The personal networks are what it’s really about: as Ashley, one of Wallach’s clients, put it: “Literally I’m meeting my [future] bridesmaids in college.” “This is exactly what happened with me,” said Wallach. “My bridesmaids were my sorority sisters.” When Wallach had a child, she recruited babysitters from her sorority. (Her daughter went on to join a different sorority, which Wallach insists didn’t bother her.)    \n",
    "\n",
    "So what do you get for your $1,800? Sorority 101 kicks things off with a seminar, in which Wallach extols the virtues of Greek life (some girls are less keen on the idea than their mothers) and describes the differences between sororities. In one-on-one meetings, she helps girls pull together their “social resumé”, boasting of accomplishments that would appear on an academic cv (grade point average, being on the debate team) and those that might not (being a prom queen or debutante).\n",

    "> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:19px\">Amid the national soul-searching that followed the murder of George Floyd, a wave of students quit their sororities and fraternities, complaining about racism, misogyny and elitism\n",
    "Wallach helps clients compile other vital parts of their applications: short video introductions (think Elle Woods in “Legally Blonde”) and letters of recommendation from sorority alumnae. She encourages them to network with current members – if the applicants are short of contacts, Wallach will put them in touch with her former clients. “This is truly just like looking for a job or applying for college,” she said.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the paperwork is submitted, it is time to prepare for the parties of rush week. Banish thoughts of bacchanals: these gatherings are more like speed-dating – highly choreographed events featuring rapid rounds of polite chit-chat. Consultants remind their clients not to respond to questions monosyllabically and to ask questions of their interlocutors. “You gotta remember these girls text a lot,” said Wallach. “They don’t talk face to face as much as we did.”\n",

    "\n",
    "Wallach’s work extends to image-consultancy. Sororities, she said, will scour girls’ social-media feeds to check they behave and dress appropriately. This means, as she told Ashley, keeping it clean on Instagram and TikTok: no photos of drunken nights out, not too much cleavage. “We want the girls to be super-genuine,” said Wallach, “but want them to do it tastefully and make sure they are presenting their best selves.” Trisha Addicks, the founder of It’s All Greek to Me, another consultancy, advises clients to post pictures of themselves having fun with their girlfriends. A red flag would be “a bunch of pics by yourself or you with a guy. They’re looking for someone who can be a friend...a good sister.”   \n",
    "\n",
    "I wonder whether Wallach ever encourages clients to alter their appearance to fit in with their chosen sorority. I think of #Rushtok, the viral TikTok genre in which rushees itemise their outfits (Top? Lululemon. Skirt? Gold Hinge. Jewellery? Dior and Hermès); with their wavy blonde hair, many looked like Athleisure Barbie. One of Wallach’s former clients, now in her second year at university, told me that as she began the application process, she became “super self-conscious and nervous” about her brown hair. “Because I wasn’t a dazzling blonde, I was like, ‘oh my God, would I need to dye my hair?’” Her application was successful, but during our call I noticed her fresh blonde highlights.\n",
    "“We want the girls to be super-genuine,” said Wallach, “but want them to do it tastefully and make sure they are presenting their best selves”\n",
    "“I have never, ever, ever had to tell a girl to change who she is,” said Wallach firmly. Her mantra is “be yourself”, otherwise you might wind up at a sorority that isn’t the right fit. Sororities’ philosophies vary: some extol the virtues of leadership; others emphasise philanthropy. Some are more into partying than others. “There is a [sorority] for every single person,” she said. “All the chapters are very inclusive.”\n",
    "This isn’t quite accurate. Every year about a fifth of applicants drop out of rush or do not receive an invitation to join a sorority, according to the National Panhellenic Conference. Some women will have to watch the Bid Day stampede from the sidelines.  <span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 10px; height: 10px; background-color: maroon; border-radius: 50%;\"></span><br>\n",
