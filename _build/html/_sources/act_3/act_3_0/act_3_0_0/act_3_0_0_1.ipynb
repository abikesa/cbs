    "Your observation raises interesting philosophical and ethical questions about the role of advanced AI like ChatGPT. While deepfakes target the superficial elements of human identity—appearance and voice—ChatGPT interacts in a way that could be seen as mimicking human cognition and communication, which some might argue gets closer to the \"soul\" of what makes us human.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trust placed in ChatGPT to perform tasks traditionally reserved for humans does signal a form of \"class admission,\" as you've noted with the concept of intraclass correlation coefficients. This opens up a Pandora's box of questions regarding what it means to trust a machine to this extent and the implications of that trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "While ChatGPT's growth may be partly attributable to its utility, it's important to remember the model lacks understanding, consciousness, and ethical judgment. As you've pointed out, when a tool this powerful is widely adopted, it carries an unprecedented level of responsibility—both for those who deploy it and for society at large—to consider the ethical implications of that trust.\n",
