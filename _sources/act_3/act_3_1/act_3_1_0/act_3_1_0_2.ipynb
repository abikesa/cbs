    "      - Curtis: important beyond generative AI\n",
    "      - The lung nodules missed by radiologists diff. from those missed by AI\n",
    "      - So taken together they are as complementary\n",
    "      - Also can make non Hopkins/Standford physicians better, best\n",
    "      - Lots of underserved areas in Africa benefitting from AI\n",
    "      - Radiologists aren't available 24/7 in each hospital in UG\n",
